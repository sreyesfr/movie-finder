# movie-finder
The movie finder app allows you to set up an account and view the movies that are available in your local area (searching by zip code). You can then click on the movies to get a description and you can click on the "Favorite!" button to make them your favorites. You can view your favorites. Favorites are stored from session to session, as well as user information. The app allows you to create a new user if you have never visited the site before, which will be stored using password js and mongo db.
